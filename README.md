# Happy Coding V1.0
Colorful theme with an essence of IDE, which inspire authors to write projects like coding fluently.

## Simple and fun
This theme is just about the colors and the font inpired by IDEs.

## I just love it
I developed the theme with no expectations, I just wanted to learn some CSS, but I absolutely loved the result and I want to share the result with you.
